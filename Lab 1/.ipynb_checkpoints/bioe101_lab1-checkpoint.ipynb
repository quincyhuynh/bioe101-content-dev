    "\n",
    "    - Trigger Source, Mode, and Level: The trigger is useful for synchronizing your display to the signal so it doesn’t scroll across your screen. Edge triggering (also called “normal” triggering) causes the display to refresh only when the signal crosses the threshold amplitude. You can trigger on either channel 1 or 2, and you can adjust the triggering threshold. You can also specify whether you want the signal to trigger on a low-high transition or a high-low transition. If “auto” is selected, the trigger values are ignored and the screen constantly refreshes. Auto triggering can be useful initially for setting up scope parameters. Try adjusting the trigger parameters and see what happens to your signal."

The wire ends should be stripped 3/16’’ to 5/16’’. Shorter stripped wires might result in bad contact with the board’s spring clips (insulation being caught in the springs).
