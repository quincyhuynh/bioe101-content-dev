    "\n",
    "- Learn about cardiac signals and EKG measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply theory of interference, CMRR, noise, and instrumentation amplifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build filters for signal conditioning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gain practical experience with soldering and protoboards\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interface conditioned analog signals with digital logic in Arduino and Python\n",

    "- Now we will use the Arduino to digitize the EKG signal. Disconnect the leads from your lab partner, disconnect the oscilloscope probes, and connect the output of your amplifier to Arduino pin A0, and the ground of your circuit to the 3.3V pin of the Arduino board.\n",
